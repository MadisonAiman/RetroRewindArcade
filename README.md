**#Retro Rewind Arcade**
Welcome to the Retro Rewind Arcade project! This is a web-based arcade website that celebrates retro gaming from the 80s and 90s, providing information about the arcade, its hours, and games.

**#Technologies Used**
HTML: The structure of the web pages.
CSS: Styles for the web pages, including layout, fonts, and animations.
JavaScript: Interactivity for the navigation and animations, enhancing user experience.

**#Features**
Smooth scrolling navigation for a seamless user experience.
Pulsating "Contact Us" button for added interactivity.
Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

**#Future Optimizations**
If the future, I would like to add images in place of the sections as z-index properities in CSS would allow me to do so. I would also like to add client testimonials. 

**#Acknowledgments**
Inspired by classic arcade games and retro culture.
Thanks to all contributors and resources that made this project possible.
